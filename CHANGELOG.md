## 0.5.0 - Git

I updated coloring for a few Git items (line removed, line added and line modified).

## 0.2.2 - 0.5.0 - Nothing

Had a couple apm publish tasks terminated, which increased version number. I decided to leave it alone.

## 0.1.1 - Menus
Started looking into pop menus (ctrl + p, ctrl + shift + p). I changed the look to better match the theme.

## 0.1.0 - First Release
* First release with base idea for theme.
