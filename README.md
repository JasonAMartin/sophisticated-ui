# Sophisticated UI

Nucleus is an adaptable UI theme for Atom with your favorite syntax coloring at its core! This gives the UI a coherent feel, with whatever syntax theme you like to use.
I love Atom.IO and use it daily, so I wanted to make a 'pretty' theme that's more elegant than what I had been using. As this was my first theme, I decided to start from a forked version of [Nucleus Dark UI](https://github.com/ignism/nucleus-dark-ui).

#### Installation

In Atom:
Settings > Install > Themes > Search for 'Sophisticated'

Via terminal:
```
apm install sophisticated-ui
```

#### Requirements

Right now, since this was forked originally, you need to have a syntax theme that has a syntax-variables.less.

As time permits, I am working to remove requirement.

#### ETC

All feedback is welcome.

#### Screens

Here's an initial screen showing Sophisticated UI with the syntax theme One Dark. More screens to come.
